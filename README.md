# Student Management System Project in Python

The Student Management System Project is a GUI-based application developed in Python using the Tkinter library and SQLite3 database. It facilitates managing comprehensive student information including name, email-id, contact number, date of birth, and their respective academic streams. This project serves as an intermediate-level application to demonstrate practical usage of databases and GUI development in Python.

## Abstract
This project utilizes Python's Tkinter library for creating a graphical interface and SQLite3 for database operations. It enables functionalities such as adding, viewing, resetting, and deleting student records. The inclusion of modules like tkcalendar, messagebox, datetime, and Ttk enhances the user experience and data management capabilities.
